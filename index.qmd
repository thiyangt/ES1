# Possible interview question


# Can you describe a time when you applied advanced statistical techniques to solve a complex problem? 


---



- tools and methods you used 

- how you communicated your findings 

---

- In one of my recent projects, I worked with a retail client to forecast product demand across multiple locations.

---

- In one of my recent projects, I worked with a retail client to forecast product demand across multiple locations.

 
- The challenge was that the sales were influenced by seasonality, promotional events, and external factors like weather. 

---

I used R to analyze this problem and develop a predictive model. 


1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:

I first used the dplyr and tidyr packages to clean the sales data, handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Then, I used lubridate to parse dates and create time-based features for seasonality.

---

2. Time Series Forecasting:

I applied ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models to forecast future sales. I used the forecast package to fit the models and validate their accuracy.

---

3. Visualization:

I visualized the forecasted data with the ggplot2 package to make the results more understandable for the client.

4. Communication:

> Your turn: Write the response that you would give to this interview question.

# Project 1

Exploring the Relationship Between Parental Involvement and Its Association with the Social and Academic Development of Kindergarten Children


How you would approach data collection for this project?




---

## Project 2

The early years of a child's life are critical for their cognitive, social, and emotional development. Research has consistently shown that parental involvement plays a significant role in shaping a child’s academic success and behavioral development. Parents who are knowledgeable about child development and effective parenting strategies are better equipped to support their child’s growth in a nurturing and productive manner.

In response to this, an organization has introduced a parent knowledge improvement program designed to enhance parents’ understanding of child development, effective parenting techniques, and strategies to foster their child's academic and behavioral growth.

## Project 2 (cont.)

What is the effect of an organization-developed parent knowledge improvement program on the academic performance and behavioral outcomes of kindergarten children?
